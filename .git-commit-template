# *** Release notes ***
#
# Release notes for new versions are automatically generated from the
# information provided in commit messages.
#
# Ticket Resolution:
#   If "Resolves: ticket_url" is found in the commit message then this ticket
#   will be automatically closed when this commit is pushed to the upstream
#   repository. The ticket will be also mentioned in the release notes as fixed.
#
#   Ideally, each commit should resolve at most one ticket. If multiple tickets
#   are resolved then repeat the whole line, i.e.:
#      Resolves: Ticket #1
#      Resolves: Ticket #2
#
# Release Notes Content
#   You can also provide short description of the fix or new feature for
#   the release notes using one of the release notes tag. The tag is associated
#   with a human readable description which is automatically put into the
#   release notes into the correct group that is determined by the tag name.
#
#   The description is read until an empty line is found. And it can contain
#   markdown language for enhanced formatting.
#
# Example:
#   SUBJECT
#
#   Commit description.
#
#   Resolves: https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/issues/XXXX
#
#   :fixes: This is an important bug that has been fixed. Keep the
#     description short but it can also span multiple lines.
