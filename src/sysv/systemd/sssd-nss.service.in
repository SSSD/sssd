# 'sssd_nss' is special in that it might be used for resolution of 'User='/'Group='/etc,
# and this may cause the service to hang (loop).
# In case SSSD needs to be configured to run as root, avoid adding 'User=root'/'Group=root' explicitly
# here for this reason (use defaults instead).
# In case SSSD was built with support of running under non-root user, there is a special
# handling in 'libnss_sss' and it is allowed to use build time configured user in 'User='/'Group='
