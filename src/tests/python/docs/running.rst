* Running Tests


Prerequisites
-------------

    pytest-multihost-plugin
    -----------------------
    To execute tests with multiple tests, pytest-multihost plugin is required. Refer to Install section for
    installing the plugin

    sssd pytest framework
    ---------------------
    sssd pytest framework is mostly set of shared functions that is used in test cases for common tasks like authconfig,
    setting up DS, kerberos, ipa, etc.  sssd-testlib is the module provided by the framework.


Getting Started
----------------
* Functional Tests mostly written for SSSD require multiple hosts. Each of the hosts take a particular role. Below are the predifined roles used:

        * master: Node on which we have Direcory Server/Openldap Server/krb5 Server/IPA Server is running
        * replica: Node on which is replica of Directory/Openldap Server/krb5 server
        * client: Node on which sssd-client is configured
        * ad: Node on which Microsoft Active Directory is running
        * atomic: Atomic host Node


config
-------

 * To run multihosts tests using pytest, we have to define the infrastructure containing RHEL and Windows systems in a file. Check Example config file::

        root_password: 'redhat'
        test_dir: '/root/multihost'
        windows_test_dir: '/home/administrator'
        domains:
          - name: testrelm.test
            type: sssd
            hosts:
              - name: hostname1
                ip: 192.168.122.1
                role: master
              - name: hostname2
                ip: 192.168.122.2
                role: replica
              - name: hostname3:
                ip: 192.168.122.3
                role: client
              - name: hostname4:
                ip: 192.168.122.4
                role: ad
                username: Administrator
                password: Secret123

    Brief description of the above lines:

    **root_password** is the root password of the systems, it's better to have common password of the RHEL systems that you would like to connect.
    Instead of password , One can use ssh keys, in which the parameter is **ssh_key_filename: ~/.ssh/id_rsa**

    **test_dir** directory to store test-specific data in, defaults to **/root/multihost_tests**

    **windows_test_dir** Directory to store test-specific data on Windows hosts, defaults to **/home/Administrator**

    **Domains** is a list of domains under which the hosts that will run the commands reside , Domains are way of classifying
        hosts,

    **name(Under Domains)** is the name of the domain , can be any name (resolvable/non-resolvable)

    **type(under Domains)** is the type of hosts, a string specifying the type of the domain ('default' by default)

    **hosts(under Domains)** is a placeholder for list of hosts

    **name(under hosts)**  is a hostname to which multihost needs to connect , can be a short name in which case FQDN will be formed by combining name and domain
    name specified under domains.

    **ip** is the ipaddress of the system
    **role** is the role that the host will be taking, like master/slave/replica/ad/atomic
    **username** (optional) each host can have it's specific username to connect to, Example for connecting Windows systems we use username 'Administrator'
    **password**  password to connect to

Executing Tests
---------------
* To execute existing tests clone sssd-qe-tests repo and run py.test against any specific test suite directory.

   * On RHEL7.2::

     $ git clone git://git.app.eng.bos.redhat.com/sssd-qe-tests.git
     $ cd sssd-qe-tests/pytest
     $ py.test --multihost-config=<multihost-template> <test-suite-directory>

* Before executing any tests, it's required to create a config file as specified in `config` section.

        * Executing test suite::

                $ cd sssd-qe-tests/pytest/
                $ py.test --junit-xml=/tmp/junit.xml \
                        --multihost-config=mh_cfg.yaml \
                        -v <test_suite_dir>

        * Executing Individual Test sub-suite (module)::

                $ cd sssd-qe-tests/pytest/
                $ py.test --junit-xml=/tmp/junit.xml \
                        --multihost-config=mh_cfg.yaml \
                        -v <test_suite_dir/test_module.py>

        * Executing individual Test cases.::

                $ cd sssd-qe-tests/pytest/

                $ py.test --junit.xml=/tmp/junit.xml \
                        --multihosts-config=mh_cfg.yaml \
                        -v <test_suite_dir>/<test_module>.py::<TestClass>::<test_case>
