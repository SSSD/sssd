Simple CA for SSSD tests

To avoid issues with certificate lifetimes during tests certificates can be
generated with a simple OpenSSL based CA.

To create a new certificate add a suitable and valid OpenSSL config file with a
[req] section for a certificate signing request (CSR) which must use the name
pattern SSSD_test_cert_*.config. Additionally a matching key file
SSSD_test_cert_key_%.pem should be added e.g. with

    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out SSSD_test_cert_key_XYZ.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

It would be possible to generate the keys automatically as well but
pre-created keys will safe some resources on the hosts running the tests,
allow more flexibility with algorithms and key lengths and make the tests
more reproducible.

The Makefile will pick up the config and the keys and generate a X.509
certificate. For usage in C-code it will generate a header file
SSSD_test_cert_x509_*.h where the base64 encoded binary certificate is made
available in a macro called SSSD_TEST_CERT_*. To run test with derived ssh-keys
the ssh key is available in SSSD_test_cert_pubsshkey_*.h as
SSSD_TEST_CERT_SSH_KEY_*.

Other targets for other types of tests can be added to the Makefile and should
be documented here.
