#This program Creates Global Groups in Windows Active Directory
#It reads groups.csv file containing list of groups. Currently
#groups.csv file contains 20 Groups
#
#To add members to the groups, this script reads users.csv
#file and adds all the users to all the 20 Groups.
#Add the Active Directory module
Import-Module ActiveDirectory

#set default password
