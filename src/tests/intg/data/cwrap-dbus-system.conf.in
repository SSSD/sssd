       with essentially infinite limits, since the bus is just running
       as the user anyway, using up bus resources is not something we need
       to worry about. In some cases, we do set the limits lower than
       "all available memory" if exceeding the limit is almost certainly a bug,
       having the bus enforce a limit is nicer than a huge memory leak. But the
       intent is that these limits should never be hit. -->
