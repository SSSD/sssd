/**
 * Provide a compile-time type safety for sbus function and its private data.
 *
 * We use GCC __typeof__ extension to achieve this. We retrieve the private
 * data type and create the expected handler function type with it. If the
 * method accepts parsed D-Bus arguments, they are appended with variadic
 * parameters. We check that the handler type matches the expected type
 * and return the sbus_handler structure value.
 *
 * We also use __attribute__((unused)) to suppress compiler warning about
 * unused __fn.
 *
 * We do not perform this check on platforms where this extension is not
 * available and just create a generic handler. This does not matter since
 * we test compilation with GCC anyway.
