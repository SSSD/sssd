/**

 *
 * If the request runs into completion, but reports a failure with HTTP return
 * code, the request will be marked as done. Only if the request cannot run at
 * all (if e.g. the socket is unreachable), the request will fail completely.
 *
 * Headers are a NULL-terminated
 * array of strings such as:
 *   static const char *headers[] = {
 *       "Content-type: application/octet-stream",
 *       NULL,
 *   };
 *
 * @param[in]  mem_ctx      The talloc context that owns the iobuf
 * @param[in]  ev           Event loop context
 * @param[in]  tctx         Use tcurl_init to get this context
 * @param[in]  req_type     The request type
 * @param[in]  socket_path  The path to the UNIX socket to forward the
 *                          request to
 * @param[in]  url          The request URL
 * @param[in]  headers      A NULL-terminated array of strings to use
 *                          as additional HTTP headers. Pass NULL if you
 *                          don't need any additional headers.
 * @param[in]  req_data     The HTTP request input data. For some request
 *                          types like DELETE, this is OK to leave as NULL.
 * @param[in]  timeout      The request timeout in seconds. Use 0 if you want
 *                          to use the default libcurl timeout.
 *
 * @returns A tevent request or NULL on allocation error. On other errors, we
 * try to set the errno as event error code and run it to completion so that
 * the programmer can use tcurl_http_recv to read the error code.
