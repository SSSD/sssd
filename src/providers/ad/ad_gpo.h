/*
 * This pair of functions provides client-side GPO processing.
 *
 * While a GPO can target both user and computer objects, this
 * implementation only supports targeting of computer objects.
 *
 * A GPO overview is at https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/wiki/GpoOverview
 *
 * In summary, client-side processing involves:
 * - determining the target's DN
 * - extracting the SOM object DNs (i.e. OUs and Domain) from target's DN
 * - including the target's Site as another SOM object
 * - determining which GPOs apply to the target's SOMs
 * - prioritizing GPOs based on SOM, link order, and whether GPO is "enforced"
 * - retrieving the corresponding GPO objects
 * - sending the GPO DNs to the CSE processing engine for policy application
 * - policy application currently consists of HBAC-like functionality
