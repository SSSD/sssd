        <title>Configuring sudo to cooperate with SSSD</title>
        <para>
            To enable SSSD as a source for sudo rules, add
            <emphasis>sss</emphasis> to the <emphasis>sudoers</emphasis> entry
            in
            <citerefentry>

        </para>
        <para>
            For example, to configure sudo to first lookup rules in the standard
            <citerefentry>
                <refentrytitle>sudoers</refentrytitle>
                <manvolnum>5</manvolnum>
            </citerefentry> file (which should contain rules that apply to
            local users) and then in SSSD, the nsswitch.conf file should contain
            the following line:

sudoers: files sss

            More information about configuring the sudoers search order from the
            nsswitch.conf file as well as information about the LDAP schema that

        <para>
            <emphasis>Note</emphasis>: in order to use netgroups or IPA
            hostgroups in sudo rules, you also need to correctly set
            <citerefentry>
                <refentrytitle>nisdomainname</refentrytitle>
                <manvolnum>1</manvolnum>

            using hostgroups).

        <title>Configuring SSSD to fetch sudo rules</title>
        <para>
            All configuration that is needed on SSSD side is to extend the list
            of <emphasis>services</emphasis> with "sudo" in [sssd] section of
            <citerefentry>
                <refentrytitle>sssd.conf</refentrytitle>
                <manvolnum>5</manvolnum>
            </citerefentry>. To speed up the LDAP lookups, you can also set
            search base for sudo rules using
            <emphasis>ldap_sudo_search_base</emphasis> option.
        </para>
        <para>
            The following example shows how to configure SSSD to download sudo
            rules from an LDAP server.
        </para>
        <para>
<programlisting>
[sssd]

services = nss, pam, sudo
domains = EXAMPLE

[domain/EXAMPLE]
id_provider = ldap
sudo_provider = ldap
ldap_uri = ldap://example.com

</programlisting>
            <phrase condition="have_systemd">
                It's important to note that on platforms where systemd is supported
                there's no need to add the "sudo" provider to the list of services,
                as it became optional. However, sssd-sudo.socket must be enabled
                instead.
            </phrase>
        </para>
        <para>
            When SSSD is configured to use IPA as the ID provider, the
            sudo provider is automatically enabled. The sudo search base is
            configured to use the IPA native LDAP tree (cn=sudo,$SUFFIX).
            If any other search base is defined in sssd.conf, this value will be
            used instead. The compat tree (ou=sudoers,$SUFFIX) is no longer
            required for IPA sudo functionality.

    <refsect1 id='cache'>
        <title>The SUDO rule caching mechanism</title>
        <para>
            The biggest challenge, when developing sudo support in SSSD, was to
            ensure that running sudo with SSSD as the data source provides the
            same user experience and is as fast as sudo but keeps providing
            the most current set of rules as possible. To satisfy these
            requirements, SSSD uses three kinds of updates. They are referred to
            as full refresh, smart refresh and rules refresh.
        </para>
        <para>
            The <emphasis>smart refresh</emphasis> periodically downloads rules
            that are new or were modified after the last update. Its primary
            goal is to keep the database growing by fetching only small
            increments that do not generate large amounts of network traffic.
        </para>
        <para>
            The <emphasis>full refresh</emphasis> simply deletes all sudo rules
            stored in the cache and replaces them with all rules that are stored
            on the server. This is used to keep the cache consistent by removing
            every rule which was deleted from the server. However, full refresh
            may produce a lot of traffic and thus it should be run only
            occasionally depending on the size and stability of the sudo rules.
        </para>
        <para>
            The <emphasis>rules refresh</emphasis> ensures that we do not grant
            the user more permission than defined. It is triggered each time the
            user runs sudo. Rules refresh will find all rules that apply to this
            user, check their expiration time and redownload them if expired.
            In the case that any of these rules are missing on the server, the
            SSSD will do an out of band full refresh because more rules
            (that apply to other users) may have been deleted.
        </para>
        <para>
            If enabled, SSSD will store only rules that can be applied to this
            machine. This means rules that contain one of the following values
            in <emphasis>sudoHost</emphasis> attribute:
