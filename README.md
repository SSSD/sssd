# SSSD - System Security Services Daemon

## Introduction
SSSD provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and
authentication mechanisms such as LDAP, Kerberos or FreeIPA. It provides
an NSS and PAM interface toward the system and a pluggable backend system
to connect to multiple different account sources.

More information about SSSD can be found on its project page -
https://github.com/SSSD/sssd.

## Downloading SSSD
SSSD is shipped as a binary package by most Linux distributions. If you
want to obtain the latest source files, please navigate to the
[Releases folder on GitHub](https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/releases).

We sign release tarballs with our [gpg key (id C13CD07FFB2DB1408E457A3CD3D21B2910CF6759)](./contrib/pubkey.asc)
since April 2022. For convenience, the key is also uploaded to
`keys.openpgp.org` keyserver. You can import the key using:

```
$ curl -o sssd.asc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SSSD/sssd/master/contrib/pubkey.asc
$ gpg2 --import sssd.asc
```

or

```
$ gpg2 --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys C13CD07FFB2DB1408E457A3CD3D21B2910CF6759
```

And verify the signature with:

```
$ version=x.y.z
$ curl -o sssd-$version.tar.gz https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/releases/download/$version/sssd-$version.tar.gz
$ curl -o sssd-$version.tar.gz.asc https://github.com/SSSD/sssd/releases/download/$version/sssd-$version.tar.gz.asc
$ gpg2 --verify sssd-$version.tar.gz.asc sssd-$version.tar.gz
```
