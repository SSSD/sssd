# SSSD - System Security Services Daemon

## Introduction
SSSD provides a set of daemons to manage access to remote directories and
authentication mechanisms such as LDAP, Kerberos or FreeIPA. It provides
an NSS and PAM interface toward the system and a pluggable backend system
to connect to multiple different account sources.
