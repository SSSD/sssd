Very Quick Guide to build sssd components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following instructions to build the libraries and the binaries.

External library requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
sssd depends on 4 libraries originated in the samba project:
talloc, tdb, tevent, ldb

They are now available in major distribution development branches.

If you want to build them from source download them from the following links:
http://samba.org/ftp/talloc/
http://samba.org/ftp/tdb/
http://samba.org/ftp/tevent/
http://samba.org/ftp/ldb/

Additionally the ding-libs are needed. These used to be included in the sssd
release but are now a separate project. The lastest ding-libs release can be
downloaded from https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/wiki/Releases#DING-LIBSReleases .

To install all of the dependencies in Fedora before building sssd:
yum install openldap-devel gettext libtool pcre-devel c-ares-devel \
    dbus-devel libxslt docbook-style-xsl krb5-devel nspr-devel \
    libxml2 pam-devel nss-devel libtevent python-devel \
    libtevent-devel libtdb libtdb-devel libtalloc libtalloc-devel \
    libldb libldb-devel popt-devel c-ares-devel check-devel \
    doxygen libselinux-devel libsemanage-devel bind-utils libnl-devel \
    gettext-devel glib2-devel

ding-libs are available in Fedora 14 and later version:
yum install  libcollection-devel  libdhash-devel  libini_config-devel \
     libpath_utils-devel  libref_array-devel

Some features, notably password caching, require the presence of a crypto
library. The default, tested by SSSD upstream, is Mozilla NSS. An alternative
crypto library can be selected during configure time using the --with-crypto
switch. Please note that alternative crypto back ends may not provide all
features -  as of this writing, password obfuscation is only supported with the
NSS back end.

How to build:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
From the root of the source, run:
autoreconf -i -f && \
./configure && \
make

Optionally, parallel builds are possible with:
autoreconf -i -f && \
mkdir parallelbuilddir && cd parallelbuilddir && \
../configure && \
make

Now you have to copy libnss_sss* into /lib (or /lib64) and add the 'sss' target
to nsswitch.conf passwd database

For pam copy pam_sss.so into /lib/security (or /lib64/security) and add
pam_sss.so to your pam configuration. To use the pam_test_client from
sss_client create the following file:

/etc/pam.d/sss_test:
auth     required pam_sss.so
account  required pam_sss.so
password required pam_sss.so
session  required pam_sss.so

Now you can call pam_test_client:
./pam_test_client [auth|chau|acct|setc|open|clos] username@domain
